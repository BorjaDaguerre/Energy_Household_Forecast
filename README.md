# Energy_Household_Forecast
Predicting one-step ahead household energy values  

One-step ahead forecast using household daily energy usage. Both linear and non-linear methods have been considered, using validation data to search for the best hyperparameters and lagged values to consider. SARIMAX, LSTM, and GRU were selected as models with custom function to account for the forecasted time horizon. Hourly dataset and results soon to come!
